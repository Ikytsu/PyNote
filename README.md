# PyNote  
*"Notion's thrifty cousin – all the organization, none of the subscription guilt."*

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This project is primarily for educational purposes. It might occasionally misbehave, like a cat on a keyboard. Use at your own risk.  

---

## 📦 Dependencies  
Before diving in, make sure you have:  
- `customtkinter` (because default Tkinter is *so* last decade)  
- `tkinter` (Linux users, if you don’t have it yet: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`)  

---

## ✨ Features (Coming Soon™)  
*"The future is bright… just not here yet."*  

### ⚙️ Custom Settings  
- **Language selection** (Parlez-vous Python?)  
- **Save directory management** (Because chaos is not a filing system.)  
- **Update warnings** (No surprises, unless you ignore them.)  
- **Custom translations** (Feeling multilingual? Submit your translations via PR!)  

### 📂 File Support  
- **Markdown** (with images! Because words alone can be lonely.)  
- **`.exmak` files** (PyNote’s *very own* quiz format—great for learning or tormenting students.)  
- **Other files** (You *can* open them… but don’t expect magic.)  

### 🖥️ Workspace & Structure  
- **Workspace selection** (For those who like compartments in their digital life.)  
- **Tree-based file organization** (Notion vibes, minus the price tag.)  

### 🎮 Command Arguments  
- `-debug` (For when things go *pear-shaped*.)  
- `-settingfile` (Because defaults are boring.)

## ❓ What’s `.exmak`?
