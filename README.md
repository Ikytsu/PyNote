# PyNote
Low budget alternative of Notion

## Warning
This project is made for educational purpose, it can be unstable for sure

``customtkinter and tkinter (for linux user who doesn't have it already)``

## Features
**Note that theses features aren't already implemented, see the plan section**

-Custom settings including:
Language selection, save directory management, and update warnings
With custom translation support, don't hesitate to pull request yours.

MarkDown files (with images support ehehe) and exmak (exercice maker file, only for Pynote) files
Other files can also be opened without the specialized integration

-Workspace selection

-Tree structure files like in notion

##exmak
.exmak files contain quiz data, you can make a .exmak file easily in Pynote to integrate this in some learning courses or idk
