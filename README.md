# PyNote
Low-budget alternative to Notion

## Warning
This project is made for educational purposes, so it may be unstable.

## Dependencies
``customtkinter`` and ``tkinter`` (for Linux users who don't have it already)

## Features
**Note that these features aren't implemented yet. See the plan section.**

- **Custom settings**, including:
  - Language selection
  - Save directory management
  - Update warnings
  - Custom translation support (feel free to contribute your translations through pull requests).

- **Support for**:
  - Markdown files (with image support!)
  - `.exmak` files (Exercise Maker files, specific to PyNote)
  - Other file types can also be opened, though they won't have specialized integration.

- **Workspace selection** for organizing different areas of your project.

- **Tree structure for files**, similar to Notion’s structure.

- **Command arguments**:
  - `-debug`
  - `-settingfile` (to use a settings file that’s not in the default folder).

## .exmak
`.exmak` files contain quiz data. You can create `.exmak` files easily in PyNote to integrate quizzes into learning courses or other educational content.

## Plan
Nothing is done yet; this will change over time. Stay tuned for updates!
